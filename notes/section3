## AWS CLI
we have to download the application then we have to create an **access key** and **aws secret access key** in order to log in from the console, also we should define a default **region name**

### Commands
* aws iam list-users

list users vale
![Alt text](images/clilistusers.png)
This is possible because the user have permissions if we remove it the user wouldn't be able to check the list of ussers. We have to go to Group, admins and add the user 

## AWS CloudShell
![Alt text](images/awscloudshell.png)
We could also crete a text file from the console and download it

## AWS Roles
A role is not a physical user it's like a virtual server
![Alt text](images/awsroles.png)

* We can create roles and assign permissions

![Alt text](images/iamsecuritytools.png)
* We can create reports to check the services used by our users and the status of their credentials

* This reports have a lot of information related with
    * user
    * created day
    * mfa active
    * access key activated or not
    * arn
* Access Advaiser is a section that shows all the servicess that the user las accessed and what don't have access
